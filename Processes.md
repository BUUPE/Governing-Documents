# Potential New Member Process 

New member induction will happen every semester around the second or third week of the term.  

We will have several events that highlight different aspects of the honor society (professional, technical, and social) that aim at mixing fun and technology. These are open to all students and should be a fun way to get to know whether they are interested in joining.  

After the events candidates will submit a brief application and we will conduct interviews for as many of the potential candidates as possible (if we are unable to meet demand we will narrow down using the application).  

The interview will have two parts: a behavioral interview and a technical interview that will test their fit within the organization and their technical expertise. Additionally, the interview will attempt to mimic real technical interviews that will give valuable experience to the candidates. 

After the interviews we will narrow down the new class to the target size (allowing variance based on the strength of the applicants) keeping in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates based on their application, resume, and performance during interviews.

Our admission philosophy draws inspiration from that of MIT:
"When we admit a class of students to MIT, it's as if we're choosing a 1,100-person team to climb a very interesting, fairly rugged mountainâ€”together. We obviously want people who have the training, stamina, and passion for the climb. At the same time, we want each to add something useful or intriguing to the team, from a wonderful temperament or sense of humor to compelling personal experiences, to a wide range of individual gifts, talents, interests and achievements. We are emphatically not looking for a batch of identical perfect climbers; we are looking for a richly varied team of capable people who will support, surprise and inspire each other."

After they have been admitted they will spend the remainder of the semester as onboarding members.
During this process the potential new members will have an informal class that will ensure that they have the technical skills to be productive members and will learn a variety of valuable technical skills. Most of the activities will focus on developing the new members professionally and technically. Some will focus on bonding the new member class with the existing members of UPE.

# Disciplinary Action

All internal complaints regarding members, officials, or new members shall be directed toward the judicial board. The judicial board is responsible to contact all involved parties and determine both the validity of the complaint and the appropriate response. In the case of severe misconduct and the judicial board determines that the consequence of the affiliated parties should be suspension or expulsion from the organization, the entire chapter will vote on the response after being briefed on the circumstances by the judicial board and letting the guilty parties defend themselves. A vote of 2/3 is required to remove a member.

# Matriculation

At the end of the semester, all the potential new members are officially onboarded as members of UPE.
